Creating a High Quality Visualization
Use the checklist below to check the quality of your work
*  Is your title engaging and clear? Is it large enough and impactful? Will it encourage your audience to have a closer look at your analysis and findings?
*  Read through everything. Are there any typos, grammatical or punctuation mistakes?
*  Step away from your screen: can you still see all the elements clearly from a distance? How do the colors look? Is the background adding to or distracting from your visualization?
*  How does your formatting look overall? Is there enough space for each element on the page or does your viz look crammed and busy?
*  Is there unnecessary data ink on the page? Could you get rid of gridlines, axes, border, shading, and other embellishments without losing context?
*  What is your key message? Is it clear and easy to understand? Are you telling a story and sharing insights? What can you do to take your visualization to the next level? Will annotation and well-placed labels guide your audience through your findings?
*  Have you formatted your tooltips?
*  Did you include your data sources and other information like your details?
*  Did you test the interactive elements such as filters, drill-downs, and animations on your visualization? Do they work as intended? And is it clear to your audience how they interact with the data?
